# Project rules

**@imjamesbarrett/agent-rules** is a TypeScript CLI tool that automatically generates markdown rule
documentation files from a centralised rules library. Instead of duplicating project guidelines
across multiple repositories, you maintain a single central rules directory (typically `~/.agents`)
and use this tool to generate project-specific markdown files that pull in relevant rules. Configure
which rules apply to your project via `agents.config.json`, then run `agent-rules generate` to
produce customised documentation with hierarchical organisation, flexible include/exclude patterns,
and automatic formatting.
